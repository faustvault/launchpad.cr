# launchpad

This utility allows you to easily extract your app and widget layout in Launchpad to a YAML file and also easily use a YAML config file to build your Launchpad layout.

**Note**: This library is still being developed and will likely undergo various major changes over the coming months until we reach a stable release.  Please use as a reference only at this point.
